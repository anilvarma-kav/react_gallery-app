# React Image Gallery App

In this project, I have used very popular React Library to create an image gallery app. This was built in the style of modern single page applications to keep it fast, modular, and in sync with current web development trends.
<br><br>

### By Doing This Project: 
I have learned some of the best practices of working with React, 
1. Using JSX to write markup-like syntax directly in JS files 
2. Managing state in a container component that passes data down to reusable stateless components.
3. Additionally, I got practice working with React supportive tools like the Create React App and React Router modules.
### How to Use:
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory in the command line/terminal.
3. Run 'npm install' 
 <br>Important: 
4. Create an account with Flickr and apply for a non-commercial API key.
5. Create a config.js file in the project's src folder.
6. In the config file add 
    ```
    const apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
    export default apiKey;
    ```
7. Run 'npm start' to view the project in your browser at:  localhost:3000
